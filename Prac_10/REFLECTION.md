1) Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

a1) I feel that as a whole, my estimations for code completion got slightly longer, but actual completion time also shortened slightly.
2) Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

a2) I have been able to spot mistakes that I would otherwise have normally made, and I also improved my coding abilities from helping my peers.

3) Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

a3) I would make the recaps for topics present in CP1401 shorter, and increase the length of time focussing on classes and OOP.
